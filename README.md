# SGN Native

My capstone project will be a React Native app for a website that I 
manage, [Stonewall Gaming Network](https://www.stonewallgaming.net). The
website provides a REST-based JSON API that I will use to provide 
authentication and interactivity with my web and mobile app.

The app will run on Android and in Web.

## Technologies and Frameworks
For this project, I'll be using the follow technologies:

1. [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
2. [React Native for Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/)
3. [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/)
4. [Gluestack-ui](https://gluestack.io/ui/nativewind/docs/home/getting-started/installation)
5. [React Native Reusables](https://rnr-docs.vercel.app/getting-started/introduction/)

## Goals

My goals are as follows:

1. Allow users to login and out
2. Allow users to view and edit their profile.
3. Allow users to update and edit Notes (ie status messages).

## Visual Aids

Please see the following images for an example of the current progress 
of the app and it's goals.
